## Sample JS Project Proposal: Conway's Game of Life with Variations

### Background

CodeRacer is a multiplayer game that helps people increase their typing speed by racing against each other online.

It utilizes open source code to help new developers become more familiar with typing underutilized keys that are quite common in computer programming.  

### Functionality & MVP  

CodeRacer will allow users to:

- [ ] Race against other users or a computer player
- [ ] See their WPM so that they can track their growth
- [ ] Track their errors and accuracy
- [ ] Choose which car they race in.
- [ ] Select which programming language they want to practice typing

In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] A landing page that allows users to learn more about the game and choose their settings
- [ ] A production README

### Wireframes

CodeRacer will contain landing page where a user will be able to choose their settings and a page that displays the race and ensuing results.
